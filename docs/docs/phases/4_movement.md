# Movement Phase
Each unit under your control can move to one adjacent land territory. There are a few different movement types that each have their own resolution rules:

* Units may move to territories that are under your control. No other movement can stop or alter this type of move.
* Units may also move to territories that currently contain no units (*expand*). If two or more players attempt to expand into the same territory, they will *Skirmish*; see below for the details.
* Units may move to a territory that is under control of another player; this is called an *Invasion*. This is the most complex part of the game; see below for the details.
* If a player moves to the same destination from two or more origins, these movements will be processed **simultaneously**, and the units will be considered as one bigger "legion" for resolving *Skirmishes* and *Invasions*.
* If there are not enough units to move from the origin to fulfill the entire move order, then the maximum amount of available units will still proceed.

    * Whenever relevant, *Skirmishes* are resolved before *Invasions*.
    * Whenever relevant, a player's moves are resolved in the order they were sent. In case of doubt, I may ask you to specify your move priorities.

## Movement rules
Each unit may move up to 2 territories per turn. Moving backwards is allowed (as in `A→B→A`).

## Skirmish
When two or more players are involved in a *Skirmish*, the following rules will resolve the conflict:

* For each involved player, remove simultaneously one unit.
* Repeat the above process until at most one player has any units remaining. These units, if any, will then proceed to occupy the target territory. If there is no winner, then the target territory remains untouched.
