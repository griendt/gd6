# Introduction

It is the sixth installment of a game of strategy, clever planning and cunning. Starting out as a forum game heavily inspired by -- and --- "Foo", [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) and [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), it quickly became something larger, each new edition adding new elements and learning from the previous.

This edition aims to be several things, just like previous games:

1. Easy for new players to get familiar with;
2. Packs all the punch of diplomacy, backstabbing and twists;
3. No randomness or luck of any kind, only strategy.

All players play their moves simultaneously, and in secret. Only the most devious can achieve domination.

## How to read this rulebook?
In principle, reading only the text that is immediately visible is important. Examples, edge cases, complex scenarios, and so on will be inside collapsible boxes like the one below. You should read these only if you are particularly interested or have questions about the main rules. Otherwise, skip them to not overload your brain.
??? "A box full of secrets"
    It's a surprise!

Especially experienced GD players should read through only the main text and pay closer attention to sections with warnings like these:
??? warning "Warning"
