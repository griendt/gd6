# Final Phase

This phase is similar to the [Natural Phase](1_natural.md) in the sense that no commands are executed in this Phase.

In this phase, the following things happen:

1. Any territory that contains a Bivouac and is not neutral will gain one Army unit, *unless* it is a Toxic Wasteland.
2. Any territory that is occupied will gain `+1` Loyalty.
3. For each territory you control, gain `+1` Influence Point.
4. For each `10` units under your control, gain `+1` Influence Point.
5. For each *HQ* under your control, gain `+6` Influence Points.

Influence Points are permanent, so you can save them up for later.

!!! warning
    Unlike previous iterations of Global Domination, the amount of IP that each player has will **not** be revealed in Turn updates!
    This way, players can purchase inventory items or other things with IP without this information leaking out from the Turn updates.
    
    I will notify each person individually (or per request) how many IP they have at their disposal each Turn.
