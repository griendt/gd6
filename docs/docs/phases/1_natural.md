# Natural Phase

## Toxic Wasteland
Any territory that is a *Toxic Wasteland* will lose one unit.
If this causes the territory to no longer contain any units, it is neutralized.

Territories can be turned into a *Toxic Wasteland* by using [Toxic Waste](3_inventory.md#toxic-waste).

??? warning "Spawning on a *Toxic Wasteland*"
    The effects of a *Toxic Wasteland* apply **before** any units are spawned.
    Therefore, if you had only one unit on such a wasteland, it **will** be rendered neutral
    and you cannot spawn any units on it!

## Bivouac
Any territory that contains a Bivouac and is not neutral will gain one Army unit, *unless* it is a Toxic Wasteland.
