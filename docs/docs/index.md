# Introduction

It is the sixth installment of a game of strategy, clever planning and cunning. Starting out as a forum game heavily inspired by [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) and [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), it quickly became something larger, each new edition adding new elements and learning from the previous.

This edition aims to be several things, just like previous games:

1. Easy for new players to get familiar with;
2. Packs all the punch of diplomacy, backstabbing and twists;
3. No randomness or luck of any kind, only strategy.

All players play their moves simultaneously, and in secret. Only the most devious can achieve domination.

## Note for recurring players

Many of the rules are the same or similar. But some things work fundamentally differently.
Big changes will be marked in warning boxes like these:

!!! warning "Warning"
    404 Headquarter Not Found

Edge cases, some examples and other info that is usually not critical will be folded in by default, to reduce clutter:

??? tip "Extra info"
