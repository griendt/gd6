# Start of the Game

1. Before the start of the first *Turn*, nobody occupies any land. There are only empty lands, indicated by a neutral colour on the map.
2. Players may join or leave the game by posting in the denominated Global Domination VI Telegram chat. Leaving, however, is strongly discouraged especially after the game has started. Please consider carefully if you are willing to commit to this game or not.

    !!! warning
        Joining is **not** done by proclaiming your preferred *Headquarter* location like in previous GD games. Instead, building a *HQ* will be considered its own type of order. See [Building an HQ](phases/2_construction#building-an-hq) for details.

3. When I consider that there are enough players to start the game, the first *Turn* will start. At this point in time, the map will still be completely empty.
4. It may be possible for more players to join later on in the game, if I think it will be suitable. Should this occur, all existing players will be notified and given enough time to revise their moves.
