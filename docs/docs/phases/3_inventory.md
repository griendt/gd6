# Inventory Phase

Each player has its own, secret *Inventory*. Items in this *Inventory* can be used during the *Inventory Phase*.

## Crop Supply
A *Crop Supply* gives your population a nutritious boost. Suppose you spawned `N` new units during *Construction Phase*. Then using a *Crop Supply* will allow you to spawn either `N` or `5` *Army* units across territories that you control at this moment, whichever is higher. Note that *Crop Supply* units are **always** of the *Army* type.

!!! warning
    This *Crop Supply*, while similar in spirit, works quite differently from previous GD games. In previous games, it would give one *Army* unit in each territory you control, which allowed big players to steamroll the map. The mechanic is now changed in the hopes of being a bit less overpowered.

??? example
    At the beginning of the game, a *Crop Supply* is good for `5` *Armies*. And if you own `17` territories, therefore spawning `7` units during *Construction Phase*, then the *Crop Supply* is good for `7` *Army* units.
    
    Note as well that if you expanded to new territories during *Construction Phase* by spawning units in neutral lands, this may influence the power of the *Crop Supply*!

## Dynamite
A stick of *Dynamite* may be thrown from one territory that you control onto any adjacent land territory. *Dynamite* is devestating. It will:

* kill one unit stationed in the target territory;
* destroy any *Bivouac*;
* turn any *Fortress* into a *Ruin*.

If the target territory contains no units after the *Dynamite* is used, it will be rendered neutral, even if the territory contained no units to begin with.

??? note "Dynamite versus Crop Supply"
    Whenever relevant, *Crop Supply* use is processed **before** *Dynamite* use. This means that freshly generated *Armies* from a *Crop Supply* can immediately get bombed, before they can even move!

## Toxic Waste
*Toxic Waste* may be used on any land territory that you control, or any adjacent land territory. Using *Toxic Waste* will turn the land into a *Toxic Wasteland*. Be careful: once a *Toxic Wasteland*, this can never be undone!
