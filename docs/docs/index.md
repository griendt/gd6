# Introduction

It is the sixth installment of a game of strategy, clever planning and cunning. Starting out as a forum game heavily inspired by [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) and [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), it quickly became something larger, each new edition adding new elements and learning from the previous.

This edition aims to be several things, just like previous games:

1. Easy for new players to get familiar with;
2. Packs all the punch of diplomacy, backstabbing and twists;
3. No randomness or luck of any kind, only strategy.

All players play their moves simultaneously, and in secret. Only the most devious can achieve domination.

!!! note
    New mechanics will be added to the game as it progresses. This has multiple reasons:
    
    1. It allows me to balance the mechanic to how I see fit, given the current state of the game;
    2. It allows all players to be familiar with all the existing rules first, making it easier for new players to get into the game.

    New mechanics _should_ never conflict with existing mechanics, only add new possibilities.

## Note for recurring players

Many of the rules are the same or similar. But some things work fundamentally differently.
Big changes will be marked in warning boxes like these:

!!! warning "Warning"
    404 Headquarter Not Found

Edge cases, some examples and other info that is usually not critical will be folded in by default, to reduce clutter:
